# 12 SQL: Employee Tracker

Project is an employee database. When started users are prompted to view Employees, Roles or Departments, Add Employees, Roles or Departments or Update Employees. If the user selects to view a table in the database they are presented with a list of the data contained in that table. If they select to add to the database they are asked follow up questions and their answers are added as a new row. If the user selects Update Employee they can retrieve an existing employee and update their role.
